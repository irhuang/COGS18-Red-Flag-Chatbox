A chatbox simulating a conversation with a dating interest, where there will be red flags throughout the dating interest's responses. There are different paths/"places" one can take in the conversation to offer variety such as ranting and getting food. As the user talks to the red flag person, red flag messages add up, and once the user has encountered more than 3 red flags without leaving the conversation, they will get a message advising against continuing (ending) the chat. If the user does leave before then, they will get a compliment. In both cases, they get a link to a resource on identifying red flags ðŸš©.
