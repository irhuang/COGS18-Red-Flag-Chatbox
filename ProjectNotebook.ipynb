    "My chatbox simulates a conversation with a dating interest, and there will be red flags throughout the dating interest's responses. There are different paths one can take in the conversation to offer variety. As the user talks to the red flag person, red flag messages add up, and once the user has encountered more than 3 red flags without leaving the conversation, they will get a message advising against continuing (ending) the chat. If the user does leave before then, they will get a compliment. In both cases, they get a link to a resource on identifying red flags. "

    "If I had more time, I would have tried to see if I can allow the user to type emojis, since most modern dating apps are online, so having being able to type emojis would be a more representative. I would also see if I can make the conversation more natural, with perhaps certain responses matched to certain inputs as opposed to randomizing everything. I would also add red flag paths to non-question inputs (right now the most red flag-y path is getting food, which is randomized to sometimes appear if you ask a question). "

I couldn't grasp it at first, so I made enough tests to meet the minimum requirements, then looked into it more. Even though I saw the applicable example on StackOverflow early on, it took me a few days to understand that it could be applied to my code. In the process of looking for ways to test inputs, I gained more sense of what tests for it do, and ended up using the code on StackOverflow I saw in the first place"
