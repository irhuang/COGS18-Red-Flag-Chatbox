    "My chatbox simulates a conversation with a dating interest, and there will be red flags throughout the dating interest's responses. There are different paths one can take in the conversation to offer variety. As the user talks to the red flag person, red flag messages add up, and once the user has encountered more than 3 red flags without leaving the conversation, they will get a message advising against continuing (ending) the chat. If the user does leave before then, they will get a compliment. In both cases, they get a link to a resource on identifying red flags. "

    "If I had more time, I would have tried to incorporate emojis, since most modern dating apps are online, so having emojis would be a more representative. I would also see if I can make the conversation more natural, with perhaps certain responses matched to certain inputs as opposed to randomizing everything. I would also add red flag paths to non-question inputs (right now the most red flag-y path is getting food, which is randomized to sometimes appear if you ask a question). "
